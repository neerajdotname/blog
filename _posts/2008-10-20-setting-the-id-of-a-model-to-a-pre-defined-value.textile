title: Setting the id of a model to a pre defined value
---
Here I am trying to create a user record with id 100.

<pre>
>> User.create(:id => 100, :status => 'active', :gender => 'm')
WARNING: Can't mass-assign these protected attributes: id
  User Create (0.000771)   INSERT INTO "users" ("status", "updated_at", "gender", "created_at") VALUES('active', '2008-10-20 19:11:41', 'm', '2008-10-20 19:11:41')
=> #<User id: 6, gender: "m", status: "active", created_at: "2008-10-20 19:11:41", updated_at: "2008-10-20 19:11:41">
>> 
</pre>

I got a warning and ActiveRecord ignored the id value that I had passed. However there is a way around to it. After the record has been created ,do an update and it will all be good.

<pre>
>> user.id = 100
=> 100
>> user.save
  User Update (0.000491)   UPDATE "users" SET "updated_at" = '2008-10-20 19:13:37' WHERE "id" = 100
=> true
</pre>

Notice that the sql does not update the id.

I worked around the issue by directly issuing the update sql.

<pre>
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.update("update users set id=34 where id = 2")
update users set id=34 where id = 2
</pre>

You can package that sql statement in a nice method.
