title: Iterating through model records in small chunck
---
If you have 1 million records and if you want to invoke save on all of them then the following strategy is a bad idea because it will load all million records in memory in one swoop.

<pre>
User.all.each { |user| user.save! }
</pre>

In order to get around to this problem in one of my previous blogs I had mentioned "this strategy":http://neeraj.name/blog/articles/635-iterating-through-models-in-small-chunks .

I am not sure when but that strategy has now become part of the core will_paginate plugin. That means I don't need to carry that code around in my application. Now all you need to do is

User.paginated_each { |user| user.save! }
