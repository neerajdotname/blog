title: I just render html and hence I do not need to worry about respond_to. Wrong!

h2. Basics

If you run <tt>ruby script/generate scaffold User name:string</tt> then you will get <tt>users_controller.rb</tt> with following code.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.xml  { render :xml => @user }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Requests like <tt>http://localhost:3000/users/4</tt> from browser will be properly rendered.

If you do not need output in xml format then most of the users quickly reduce the above code to

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
end
{% endhighlight %}

Reducing 7 lines of code to 3 lines of code looks cleaner but it comes with a price.

h2. Problem Definition

I wrote  a blog and someone put a link to this blog in his blog. However mistakenly the link did not come out right. The link turned out to be

{% highlight ruby %}
http://localhost:3000/articles/4.php
{% endhighlight %}

I would get following error in my application.

{% highlight ruby %}
Missing template users/show.erb
{% endhighlight %}


The reality is that I only wanted to handle html files so I had <tt>show.html.erb</tt>. However I did not have any file called <tt>show.erb</tt>


The same problem could come from other unexpected sources like bots.
Some of the bots hit the site with url like <tt>http://localhost:3000/users/4.rss</tt>


h2. Solution

Fix is simple. It was provided by scaffold generator output.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

With the above fix, the request like <tt>http://localhost:3000/users/4.rss</tt> would be sent a response like this

{% highlight ruby %}
406 Not Acceptable [http://localhost:3000/users/4.rss]    
{% endhighlight %}


Think before you remove respond_to code. Even though your application is meant to provide only html responde respond_to is a useful tool. <br />
