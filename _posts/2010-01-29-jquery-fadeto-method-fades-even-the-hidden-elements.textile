title: jQuery fadeTo method fades even the hidden elements
---

<i>Following code has been tested with jQuery 1.4.1 . Code demo links are the end of the blog .</i>

"fadeTo":http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo method of jQuery ,strangely, fades event the hidden elements.

Here is html markup. 

<pre>
<style> #hello p { display: none;}</style>
<div id='hello'>
  <p>this is p inside hello</p>
</div>
<p>This is p outside hello</p>
</pre>

Since the first <tt>p</tt> is hidden, you will see only one <tt>p</tt> element in the browser. Now execute following jQuery code.

<pre>
$('p').fadeTo('slow', 0.5');
</pre>

You will see  both the <tt>p</tt> elements.


jQuery goes out of its way to make sure that hidden elements are visible. Here is <tt>fadeTo</tt> method.

<pre>
fadeTo: function( speed, to, callback ) {
	return this.filter(":hidden").css("opacity", 0).show().end()
				.animate({opacity: to}, speed, callback);
}
</pre>

Also notice that for a hidden element fadeTo operation starts with opacity of zero, while other elements will go down towards zero.

Checkout the same demo in slow motion and notice that while the first p element emerges out of hiding, the other p element is slowing fading. This might cause unwanted effect . So watch out for this one.
