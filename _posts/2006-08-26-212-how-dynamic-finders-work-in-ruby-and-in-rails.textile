title: How dynamic finders work in Ruby and in Rails
---
Rails allows one to write code like  

{% highlight ruby %}User.find_by_email("neeraj@gmail.com");{% endhighlight %}

Another version is  

{% highlight ruby %}User.find_all_by_state("MD").{% endhighlight %}

How is it accomplished?</p>
