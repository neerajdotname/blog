title: FileList from Rake
---
While browsing through the code for the rake method "rake log:clear" this is what I noticed.

<pre>
    FileList["log/*.log"].each do |log_file|
      f = File.open(log_file, "w")
      f.close
    end
</pre>

I had never seen FileList before. I looked for it in Ruby core but couldn't find it. Then I found out that FileList comes from rake.  "Here":http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/FileList.html is the doc. FileList seems similar to "Dir.glob":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Dir.html#M002347

This is how I delete all the log files every time I start radrails on my machine. I use Dir.glob .

<pre>
require 'fileutils'
dir = File.join('d:','dev','**','log','*.log*')
Dir.glob(dir).each do|f| 
	FileUtils.rm_rf(f)
end
</pre>

In the above case Dir.glob can be substituted by FileList and it will work fine as long as we add a line "require 'rake' ".

It seems FileList and Dir.glob serve similar purpose. However FileList has one major advantage over Dir.glob . The search does not begin until the search is actually made.

Performance wise I am not sure which one works out faster but it's good to know new tools.
