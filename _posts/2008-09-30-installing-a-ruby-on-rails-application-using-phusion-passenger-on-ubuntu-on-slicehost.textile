title: Installing a ruby on rails application using phusion passenger on ubuntu on slicehost
---
Given below are the exact steps I follow every single time I need to install a ruby on rails application on a new slice on slicehost.

There are a number of automated scripts out there which will make it easier to setup your box but I like to know what's happening and hence I prefer to do it manually. Anyway it takes only 30 minutes to setup the box with the instructions mentioned below.
