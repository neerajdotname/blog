title: session_expiration_management plugin to allow users to extend their sessions

__Following code is tested with Rails 2.3 .__

Most of the bank sites log you out or allow you to extend your session if you are inactive for a while. This plugin provides an opportunity for users to extend their sessions before they are logged out.

More information about how to use and how to configure this plugin is available at "github":http://github.com/neerajdotname/session_expiration_management .<br />
