title: Configuring the ubuntu box on slicehost
---

This article is part of a series on "Installing a ruby on rails application using phusion passenger on ubuntu on slicehost":http://neeraj.name/2008/09/30/installing-a-ruby-on-rails-application-using-phusion-passenger-on-ubuntu-on-slicehost.html .

<h2>Ubuntu 8.04.1</h2>
I am running Ubuntu 8.04.1 on my slice that I got from slicehost.com . The instructions mentioned here might or might not work for other linux flavor.

<h2>Adding a new user </h2>

If you are using mac or linux then try 

<pre>
ssh root@123.45.67.890
# to change password
passwd
</pre>

<h2> Adding a new user </h2>
Let's create a new user named 'neeraj'

<pre>
adduser neeraj
#It will prompt for password and password confirmation. 
</pre>

Let's provide sudo access to this user 'neeraj'

<pre>
visudo
</pre>

Go to the end of file and add the following line .

<pre>
neeraj ALL=(ALL) ALL
</pre>

save the data and exit.

Logout of your slice and log back in with userid neeraj and password you used to create this userid. In fact now you donâ€™t need to login as root ever. Login as neeraj and when you need root access all you need to do is

<pre>
sudo -i
</pre>

<h2> ssh setup </h2>


<pre>
# get out of slicehost and make sure that you are at your local
# machine prompt

# Generate ssh key 
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# copy the public key to the server. below replace 12.345.67.890 
# with the ip address of your box
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub neeraj@12.345.67.890:/home/neeraj/

# ssh into the box and create a directory
mkdir /home/neeraj/.ssh

# move and rename the public key
mv /home/neeraj/id_rsa.pub /home/neeraj/.ssh/authorized_keys

# change owner
chown -R neeraj:neeraj /home/neeraj/.ssh

# change permission
chmod 700 /home/neeraj/.ssh

# change permission
chmod 600 /home/neeraj/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<h2> Check the OS we are running </h2>

<pre>
cat /etc/lsb-release

# the ouptput would be something like
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=8.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=hardy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.04.1" 
</pre>

<h2> Set aliases </h2>

<pre>
vi ~/.bash_profile

# add following lines to .bash_profile
alias free="free -m" 
alias update="sudo aptitude update" 
alias install="sudo aptitude install" 
alias upgrade="sudo aptitude safe-upgrade" 
alias remove="sudo aptitude remove" 
</pre>

<h2> Configure bash profile </h2>

<pre>
vi ~/.bash_profile
# Add following line at the bottom of the file
export PS1="\n\[\e[36;1m\]\u@\[\e[32;1m\]\H:\w\n> \[\e[0m\]" 
</pre>

Get out of file and reload the changes by running

<pre>
source ~/.bash_profile
</pre>

<h2> Set locale </h2>

<pre>
sudo locale-gen en_GB.UTF-8
sudo /usr/sbin/update-locale LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
mkdir ~/tmp
</pre>

<h2> uptodate your machine </h2>

<pre>
sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
sudo aptitude full-upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo aptitude install build-essential
sudo apt-get install build-essential
</pre>

restart the box

<pre>
sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>


<h2> Change ssh password </h2>

If sometime later you need to change the ssh password then use this command.

<pre>
passwd
</pre>

It will prompt for old and new passwords.
