title: capistrano set  deploy_via,  export
---
capistrano 2.0  provides the ability to set deploy_via export. This will ensure that no .svn files are there in the app directory and ,I guess, that's a good thing.

<pre>
# the default behavior
set :deploy_via, :checkout

# use export, rather than checkout
set :deploy_via, :export
</pre>

When I switched to :export I ran into one problem. I use "acts_as_releaseable":http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/acts_as_releaseable plugin to see the release version in staging and production environment. Now that no svn files are there I don't see any svn version.

I reverted my deploy strategy back to :checkout from :export.
