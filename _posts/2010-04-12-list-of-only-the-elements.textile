title: List of only the elements that contains 
published: false

I was toying with the "simple list filter plugin":http://kilianvalkhof.com/2010/javascript/how-to-build-a-fast-simple-list-filter-with-jquery/ and ended up with this markup.

<pre>
<div id="lab">
  <ul id="list">
    <li><a href="">USA</a></li>
  <ul>
  <p>
    <a href=''>USA</a>
  </p>
</div>
</pre>

I want to get all links that contains the word <tt>USA</tt>. Simple enough. jQuery supports <tt>contains</tt> selector.

<pre>
$(":contains('USA')");
</pre>

Above query results in following items. 

<pre>
[html, body#body, div#lab, ul#list, li, a, ul, p, a]
</pre>

That is because "contains":http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector looks for given string under all the descendants.

h2. has method to rescue

jQuery has "has":http://api.jquery.com/has method which returns the list of elements which have a descendant which has the given string.

<pre>
b = $('*').has(":contains('USA')");
</pre> 

Above query results in following items.

<pre>
[html, body#body, div#lab, ul#list, li, ul, p]
</pre>

h2. Final result

<pre>
a = $(":contains('USA')");
b = $('*').has(":contains('USA')");
c = a.not(b) ;
console.log(c);
</pre>

Above query results in following items.

<pre>
 [a, a]
</pre>
