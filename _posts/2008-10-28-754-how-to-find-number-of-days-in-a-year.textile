title: How to find number of days in a year
---
You would think it would be easy to find number of days in a given year in Ruby/Rails world, where lots of useful methods are by present by default. 

There are multiple solutions and you can follow the discussion "here":http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-talk-google/browse_thread/thread/a6a4bf5ca179dfa1/1b3517a25ec17338?show_docid=1b3517a25ec17338&pli=1 . However the best solution was posted at the very end.

{% highlight ruby %}
# yday represents the day of the year
>> Time.now.yday
=> 302

# to get the number of days in a year use yday
>> require 'date'
>> DateTime.new(2008,12,31).yday
=> 366
>> DateTime.new(2009,12,31).yday
=> 365
{% endhighlight %}

Nifty usage of yday method.
