title: restful path with other options

Let's say that I have a restful resource called cities. I want to create a link to a city using restful style. I also want to add additional param[:type]='upcomig' and I want to pass html option 'target' => '_blank'.

Try to spot the right one here. I do not know why it took me a while to get the right syntax.

<pre>
link_to 'Bangalore', city_path(@city),:type => 'up' , {:target => '_blank'} 

link_to 'Bangalore',  { city_path(@city,:type => 'up') } , {:target => '_blank'} 

link_to 'Bangalore', city_path(@city,:type => 'up') , {:target => '_blank'} 

link_to 'Bangalore', city_path(@city), {:type => 'up'} , {:target => '_blank'} 
</pre>

The right answer is third one.
