title: Freezing a particular version of rails
---
Softies on Rails blogged about "how to freez rails":http://softiesonrails.com/2008/1/3/freezing-your-rails-application . This is a great article except one thing. The article didn't mention how to freeze a particular version of Rails. 

I needed to freeze Rails 1.2.5 to an old application. I googled and following is the answer.

{% highlight ruby %}
rake rails:freeze:edge TAG=rel_1-2-5

rake rails:freeze:edge TAG=rel_1-2-6

rake rails:freeze:edge TAG=rel_2-0-0_RC2
{% endhighlight %}
