title: Use alias_attribute to get an easy to remember name for your column operations
---
I am working on a project where the user table has columns fname and lname. While writing the code I often type first_name and last_name and the code would blow up. Today I found a nice fix. Use alias_attribute.

<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  alias_attribute :first_name,:fname
end

>> u.fname
=> "Neeraj Singh"
>> u.first_name
=> "Neeraj Singh"
>> u.fname = 'Foo Bar'
=> "Foo Bar"
>> u.first_name
=> "Foo Bar"
</pre>

Rails is really full of surprises and goodies. <br />
