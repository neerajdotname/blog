title: Putting a marker before every new request
---
Rails does an excellent job of printing log messages. However as the application grows, sometimes it becomes difficult to pinpoint exactly where the log for a new request started.

I would like to have a special line to be printed before a controller starts processing a new request. In this way before each request in the log message I will get to see that special marker.

This is the simple hack I implemented.


<pre>
if RAILS_ENV == 'development'

    # this puts a marker before the start of every new controller request
    module ActionController
      class Base
        def log_processing
          if logger && logger.info?
            logger.info "\n\n" + '*' * 100        
            logger.info "Processing #{controller_class_name}\##{action_name} (for #{request_origin}) [#{request.method.to_s.upcase}]"
            logger.info "  Session ID: #{@_session.session_id}" if @_session and @_session.respond_to?(:session_id)
            logger.info "  Parameters: #{respond_to?(:filter_parameters) ? filter_parameters(params).inspect : params.inspect}"
          end
        end
      end
    end
end
</pre>

This has proved to be a big help so far.
