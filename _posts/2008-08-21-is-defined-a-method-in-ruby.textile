title: Is defined? a method in ruby
---
defined? is a useful method in many ways.

<pre>
> irb
>> x = 100
=> 100
>> defined? x
=> "local-variable"
>> defined? y
=> nil
>> NAME = 'foo'
=> "foo"
>> defined? NAME
=> "constant"
>> class Person
>>   end
=> nil
>> defined? Person
=> "constant"
</pre>

defined? can be used to find out if a variable is defined or not? In the above example y is not a defined variable and we got the return value as nil. Notice that for Person class defined? returned it  a constant.

If you go to the "ruby documentation":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/ you won't find any method named 'defined?'. Then what's going on here?

Well defined? is not a method. It is a keyword. "Click here":http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/methodCheckDefined.html for a detailed explanation of why is that. 

If you are really interested in seeing the implementation of defined? in ruby c code then "click here":http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/branches/ruby_1_8_7/eval.c?revision=18327&view=markup and search for is_defined .
