title: Evaluating a boolean operation can return non boolean value in both ruby and in JavaScript
---
<pre>
a = 10
b = 20
c = a && b
puts c #=> 20
</pre>

When  I look at code like this, my brain assumes that return value would be a boolean and not 20.

However that is slowly changing. 

As I spend more time looking a JavaScript code I am embracing this style of coding. The above code is ruby code and I do not see many cases of assigning a value like this in ruby. May be it is not in the cultural DNA of ruby. In ruby world I have used or operation to assign value to a variable.

<pre>
a = 10
b = 20
c = a || b
puts c #=> 10
</pre>

However in JavaScript land it is a different story. Checkout following code from jQuery.

<pre>
complete: fn || !fn && easing || jQuery.isFunction( speed ) && speed
</pre>

At first I thought second condition would assign a boolean value to <tt>complete</tt>. However if second condition is true then value assigned to complete would be <tt>easing</tt> which is a <tt>truthy</tt> value.

Embracing a new language is making brain unlearn a few things.
