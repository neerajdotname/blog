title: An inline confirmation utility powered by jQuery
---

While developing [Page41.com](http://www.page41.com) I needed inline confirmation utility. 

With jQuery it was easy. After a few hours I had <tt>iconfirm</tt>. 

[Source code](http://github.com/neerajdotname/iconfirm) is at github.

[Live Demo](http://neerajdotname.github.com/iconfirm/) is also available.
