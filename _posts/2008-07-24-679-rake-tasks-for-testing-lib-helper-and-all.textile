title: rake tasks for testing lib, helper and all
---
Rails provides us tasks like rake test:units and rake test:functionals. But what about tests that I write for lib and helpers.

I create two more directories under test: lib and helpers. I put all my lib related tests in test/lib directory and I put all helper related tests in test/helpers.

Now I would like to have rake test:libs and rake test:helpers. Also when I run 'rake' then I would like rake to also run tests under lib and helpers directory. This is the fix I came up with .

<pre>
namespace :test do
  Rake::TestTask.new(:libs => "db:test:prepare") do |t|
    t.libs << "test"
    t.pattern = 'test/lib/**/*_test.rb'
    t.verbose = true
  end
  Rake::Task['test:libs'].comment = "Run the tests in test/lib"


  Rake::TestTask.new(:helpers => "db:test:prepare") do |t|
    t.libs << "test"
    t.pattern = 'test/helpers/**/*_test.rb'
    t.verbose = true
  end
  Rake::Task['test:helpers'].comment = "Run the tests in test/helpers"
end

desc 'Run all unit,lib, functional and integration tests'
task :test do
  errors = %w(test:libs test:units test:functionals test:integration).collect do |task|
    begin
      Rake::Task[task].invoke
      nil
    rescue => e
      task
    end
  end.compact
  abort "Errors running #{errors.to_sentence}!" if errors.any?
end

</pre>

It works.
