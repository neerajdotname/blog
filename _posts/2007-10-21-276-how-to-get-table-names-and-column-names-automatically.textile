title: How to get table names and column names automatically
---
Recently in a project, I had to get all the table names and the column names for each of the table for a given database.  The final code is really simple but I had to do some digging around.

{% highlight ruby %}
#get the table names
tables = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables 

tables.each do |table|
       #get the column names for a given table
      columns = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.columns(table)
end 
{% endhighlight %}
