title: Inject for array
---
"Inject":http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Enumerable.html#M003140 is awesome.  I was going through comments of "this blog":http://buddingrubyist.com/2008/02/05/why-i-like-to-inject/ and learned something new today.

Given below is a case where I need to add all the numbers. One way to solve would be something like this.

{% highlight ruby %}
ar = [[:a, 1], [:b, 2], [:c, 3]]
c = ar.inject(0) do |sum, record|
  sum += record[1]
end
puts c #=> 6
{% endhighlight %}

Here is another way to solve the same problem.

{% highlight ruby %}
ar = [[:a, 1], [:b, 2], [:c, 3]]
d = ar.inject(0) do |sum, (first, second)|
  sum += second
end
puts d
{% endhighlight %}

The second parameter in the block is split based on pattern. If the inner array has three elements then all the three elements can be split based on  pattern.

{% highlight ruby %}
ar = [[:a, 1, 11], [:b, 2, 22], [:c, 3, 33]]
d = ar.inject(0) do |sum, (first, second, third)|
  sum += third
end
puts d #=> 66
{% endhighlight %}
