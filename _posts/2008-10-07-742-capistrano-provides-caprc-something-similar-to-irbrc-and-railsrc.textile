title: Capistrano provides .caprc ; something similar to .irbrc and .railsrc
---
I use roll_my_blog, a blogging engine that I developed, to power this blog. It means I use the exact same code that is available for public to view as open source, to run my blog.

One of the things I wanted to hide was the user name which I use to log into my slice to deploy the application. The deploy.rb file had following code.

{% highlight sh %}
set :user, 'my_real_user_name'
{% endhighlight %}

I wanted to hide my real user name that I use to log into the box. But at the same time I wanted to run the exact copy that is released to public as open source.

.caprc file came to rescue. It's simple. I created a ~/.caprc file on my mac. This is what the content of the file looks like.

{% highlight sh %}
> cat ~/.caprc
set :user, 'my_real_user_name'
{% endhighlight %}

Now my real user name that I use to login to the box is hidden from general public.
