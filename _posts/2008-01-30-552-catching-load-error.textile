title: Catching load error
---
While going through the admitter code i noticed this. The trick is to place the load in a method and then call that method to find out if the load was successful or not.

{% highlight ruby %}
# this needs to be placed in a method or else rescue doesn't work
def load_image_science
  require 'image_science'
  $image_science_installed = true
rescue LoadError # in case they don't have it installed
  $image_science_installed = false
end
load_image_science

# Later in the code use 
if $image_science_installed
#...
end
{% endhighlight %}
