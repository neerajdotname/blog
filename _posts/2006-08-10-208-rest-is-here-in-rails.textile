title: REST is here in Rails
---
A  week agon <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/">Ryan</a> posted an excellent article about the upcoming support for <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it">REST in rails</a>. If this is the first time  you are hearing about REST then please do some googling and you will find a ton of articles explaining how this simple principle is kissing the ass of Web-Services. Look at this example to see the power of REST.

Assuming I have a standard <tt>users_controller</tt> I would add the following to my routes:

<pre> map.resources :users </pre>

Yeah, that's it. And with that declaration, here are the requests that are mapped for me (all to the <tt>users</tt> controller):

<pre>
GET: /users => [:action => 'index']
GET: /users.xml => [:action => 'index', :format => 'xml']
GET: /users/1 => [:action => 'show', :id => 1]
GET: /users/1;edit => [:action => 'edit', :id => 1]
GET: /users/1.xml => [:action => 'show', :id => 1, :format => 'xml']

POST: /users => [:action => 'create']
PUT: /users/1 => [:action => 'update', :id => 1]
DELETE: /users/1 => [:action => 'destroy', :id => 1]
</pre>
