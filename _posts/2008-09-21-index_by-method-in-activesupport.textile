title: index_by method in activesupport
---
Let's say that you have an array of User records. You would like to convert that array into a hash where the key of the hash will be the user email address. ActiveSupport has a good utility method for that.

<pre>
users = User.all :conditions => 'id < 5'
h = users.index_by(&:email)
h['sample.user@example.com'] = # user record
</pre>
