title: Commenting out the code in .rhtml
---
While teaching RoR I encountered many people were commenting out the ruby code in .rhtml wrong way.

<pre>
< %#  %>
</pre>

This is a valid comment. Everything inside < % %>  is pure ruby code and just like standard ruby code anything after # is ignored.
