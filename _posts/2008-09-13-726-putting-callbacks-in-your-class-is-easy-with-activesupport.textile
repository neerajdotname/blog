title: putting callbacks in your class is easy with ActiveSupport
---
Rails models have a number of callbacks. Some of the most common callbacks in practice are before_save, after_save and before_destroy etc.

Let's assume that we have a class and we want to add some callbacks. We go about implementing the callbacks ourselves but why bother. ActiveSupport makes it so easy.

In the following code we wan to have a callback whenever the method make_payment is called.

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
require 'activesupport'

class Event
  include ActiveSupport::Callbacks
  define_callbacks :make_payment
end


class MyEvent < Event
  def make_payment
    puts 'make_payment is called'
  end
end

MyEvent.new.make_payment
</pre>
