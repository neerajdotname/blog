title: Hibernate collection filters
---
Hibernate collection filter is a good tool when one wants a filter to be applied to a collection of items. For example: if you want to have all employees of a company with salary &gt; 100, the sql would be something like this:

<pre> List results= session.createFilter(company.getEmployees(), "where this.salary > 100").list(); </pre>

The  thing to watch out for the query string that is passed to the method. The query is taken literally. It means if you have a boolean property then do not pass the value as boolean. To further extend the example, if one needs to find out if the employee is a full time employee of part time employee, something like this needs tobe done.

<pre> List results= session.createFilter(company.getEmployees(),"where this.fulltime='Y'").list();</pre>

Notice that in this case I am passing 'Y' and not a boolean value. If the database has value 0 or 1 in your case, then one needs to accommodate the change accordingly.
