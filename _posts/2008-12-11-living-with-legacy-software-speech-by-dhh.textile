title: Living with Legacy Software  Speech by DHH
---
This is an "old video":http://railsconfeurope.blip.tv/file/1555560/ but I highly recommend watching it. This presentation was done by DHH at RailsConf Europe 2008.

It changed the way I perceive legacy code. 

The  important lessons for me were 

- the moment a code is committed that code is a legacy code.

- if I perceive my code a legacy written a month ago then it is a good thing because the code has not changed. What has changed is my perspective about how to code for the given problem. The fact that I perceive my own code as legacy means I have learned something over time and learning is good.
