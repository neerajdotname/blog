title: Convenient Finder Parameter in Rails
---
Going through <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/">Ryan's blog</a> I am finding a lot of good stuff hidden in Rails. <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/4425">This one</a> is really sweet.

Before:

{% highlight ruby %}
Article.find(:all, :conditions =>
[ "author_id = ? and status = ?", @author.id, 'published' ], :limit => 10)
{% endhighlight %}

Now:

{% highlight ruby %}
Article.find(:all, :conditions =>
{ :author_id => @author.id, :status => 'published' }, :limit => 10)
{% endhighlight %}

Don't worry about sql injection. The params are sanitized before being used.

Isn't Rails sweet?
