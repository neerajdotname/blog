title: gem to quickly test your javascript  javascript_lab
---
Personally I am liking jQuery over Prototype but there are many projects which use Prototype and I keep juggling between the two javascript libraries. I needed a tool to quickly test my javascript code without worrying about including the right version.

I ended up creating this gem calld <tt>javascript_lab</tt>. 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install neerajdotname-javascript_lab
{% endhighlight %}

Once the gem is installed then on the command line type <tt>javascript_lab</tt> and a browser should come up.


This tiny gem also demostrates the enormous power of Sinatra. Sinatra is a perfect tool for such cases when you want to embed a server inside your gem.

A big thanks to the author of "gembox":http://github.com/quirkey/gembox/tree/master which inspired this gem.

Give it a try. Send me feedback if you have any.
