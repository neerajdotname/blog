title: Order of format matters in respond_to block
---

This is a standard Rails code. I am using Rails 2.3.5 .

<pre>
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.js  { render :json => @users }      
    end
  end
end
</pre>

Accidentally in one of my controllers the order of formats got reversed. The altered code looks like this.

<pre>
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.js  { render :json => @users }      
      format.html      
    end
  end
end
</pre>

I thought order of format declaration does not matter. I was wrong.

<pre>
> curl -I http://localhost:3000/users
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close

Content-Type: text/javascript; charset=utf-8

Content-Length: 2

</pre>

Notice the the Content-Type of in the response header is <strong>text/javascript</strong> in stead of <strong>text/html</strong> .

Well I guess the order of format matters. I hope it is fixed in Rails 3.
