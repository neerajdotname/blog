{% highlight ruby %}
name ||= ' hello world '

name &&= name.strip

puts name == 'hello world' #=> true
{% endhighlight %}

In the above case I could have used strip! but I just wanted to show a contrived usage of <tt>&&=</tt> .

I see <tt>||=</tt> all the time but I rarely see <tt>&&=</tt> .
