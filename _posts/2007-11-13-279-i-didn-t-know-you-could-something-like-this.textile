{% highlight ruby %}
if event_date >= today
        @todays_events
elsif event_date == yesterday
        @yesterdays_events
else
        @events
end << event

{% endhighlight %}

rather than doing

{% highlight ruby %}
if event_date >= today
        @todays_events << event
elsif event_date == yesterday
        @yesterdays_events << event
else
        @events << event
end 
{% endhighlight %}
