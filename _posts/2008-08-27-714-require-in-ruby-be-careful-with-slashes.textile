title: require in ruby  be careful with slashes
---
Let's look at code.

{% highlight ruby %}
require File.expand_path(File.dirname('__FILE__') + '/foo.rb')
{% endhighlight %}

Above require statement looks okay and it will work on your computer. But this is not the best way to handle files. On a system that doesn't understand forward slash, above code might create problem. Above code might not work in windows.

A better solution would be.

{% highlight ruby %}
require File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname('__FILE__')) , 'foo.rb')
{% endhighlight %}

In this case ruby will take care of OS level complexities.
