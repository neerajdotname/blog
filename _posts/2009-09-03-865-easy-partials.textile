title: Easy partials
---
__Following code has been tested with Rails 2.3 .__

Traditional way of rendering partials.

<pre>
render :partial => 'comments/comment', :locals => { :comment => comment, :show_article_title => false}
</pre>

Above code can also be written as 

<pre>
render 'comments/comment', :comment => comment, :show_article_title => false
</pre>

One more example.

<pre>
render :partial => 'comment', :locals => { :comment => comment, :show_article_title => true }
render 'comment', :comment => comment, :show_article_title => true
</pre>

I continue to see everyone use the version with keyword 'partial'.
