title: Implementing rot13 in Ruby
---
In one of the Java projects  rot13 encryption needs to be implemented. People are scrambling for the jar file that has the rot13 logic.

Well in Ruby it's easy. Here is how it can be done.

{% highlight ruby %}
class String
  def rot13
     self.tr("A-Ma-mN-Zn-z","N-Zn-zA-Ma-m")
  end
end

#Now let's use it
s = "I love Ruby"
encrypted_s = s.rot13
{% endhighlight %}

I was surprised by the tr method in Ruby String. I had never used it before. As per the doc


<blockquote>
Returns a copy of str with the characters in from_str replaced by the corresponding characters in to_str.
"hello".tr('aeiou', '*')    #=> "h*ll*"
</blockquote>
