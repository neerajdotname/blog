title: Validating non active record model using active_record_no_table
---
Sometimes I need a model which does not have a corresponding table. I would like to use all the validation goodies that come with ActiveRecord in this model. ActiveRecord makes using validation tools in a non ActiveRecord model very difficult.

I have posted the solution on how to accomplish the same for "Rails 2.1 here":http://www.neeraj.name/blog/articles/646-validating-non-active-record-models-for-rails-2-1 and for "Rails 2.2 here":http://www.neeraj.name/blog/articles/810-validating-non-activerecord-models-in-rails-2-2 .

After implementing the solution in a number of projects, I got tired and converted the solution into a gem. I have tested this gem with Rails 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 and it seems to be working.

Using the gem is easy.

<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::NoTable
   validates_presence_of :name
   attr_accessor :name
end
</pre>

<pre>
>> user = User.new
>> user.valid?
>> user.errors.full_messages
>> ["Name can't be blank"]
</pre>
