title: How to validate date
---
RoR is awesome tool but I have failed to find a better way to validate a date.

{% highlight ruby %}
def
  begin
    Date.new(yyyy.to_i,mm.to_i,dd.to_i)
  rescue ArgumentError => e
  end  
end
{% endhighlight %}


Until I find a better way, I am sticking with this one.
