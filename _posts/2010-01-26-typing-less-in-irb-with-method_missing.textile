title: Typing Less in Irb with method_missing
keywords: method_missing tips, type less, irb shortcuts, efficient ruby console, ruby shortcuts, instant aliasing, underscore search, textmate search
description: Being the console-efficient prick I am, let's look at a <code>method_missing</code> that let's us type less where underscored methods are involved. This means that instead of typing <code>some_really_long_ass_method</code> we can type the shortcut method <code>s_r_l_a_s</code>.

{{page.description}} Instant aliasing! As you can see this works by typing the beginning letter of each word separated by underscores.

So why do this if we have autocompletion? For starters, try typing the @Object@ method @instance_variable_get@ in five keystrokes (tabs included). Or for more inefficiency, try typing @ActiveRecord@ class methods that start with @before_*@ and @validate_*@.
