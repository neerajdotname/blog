title: Dir.glob vs Dir.chdir + more
---
I am writing a plugin and I needed list of all models. Here is my first attempt.

{% highlight ruby %}
>> Dir.glob("#{RAILS_ROOT}/app/models/**/*.rb")
=> ["/Users/nkumar/dev/working/roll-admin-model/app/models/article.rb", "/Users/nkumar/dev/working/roll-admin-model/app/models/comment.rb", "/Users/nkumar/dev/working/roll-admin-model/app/models/user.rb"]
{% endhighlight %}

The result is the name of all the models with absolute path. This is not what I wanted but it is good to know incase I need it sometime in future.

Here is the revised version.

{% highlight ruby %}
> model_dir = File.join(RAILS_ROOT,'app','models')
=> "/Users/nkumar/dev/working/roll-admin-model/app/models"
>> Dir.chdir(model_dir) { models = Dir["**/*.rb"] }
=> ["article.rb", "comment.rb", "user.rb"]
{% endhighlight %}

Yeap. That did it.
