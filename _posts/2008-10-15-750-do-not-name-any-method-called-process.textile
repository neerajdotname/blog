title: Do not name any method called 'process'
---
I named a controller method as 'process' and was getting following error:

<pre>
 Status: 500 Internal Server Error
 wrong number of arguments (2 for 0)
</pre>

After some head scratching I "found that":http://groups.google.ca/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/f44ff644d2c29977 you can't name a method as 'process'.
