title: Representing string in alternate ways
---
Using quotation ( single or double) sometimes gets in the way. I use the alternate notation sometimes. But I use it so rarely that when I do need to use it, I need to refer a book. So here it is for my own reference.

<pre>
s1 = %q[ this acts like a single quotation string]
s2 = %Q[ this acts like a double quotation string]

s3 = <<EOF
this is like 
a double quotation
string
EOF

s4 = <<'EOF'
this is like
a single 
quotation
string
EOF
</pre>
