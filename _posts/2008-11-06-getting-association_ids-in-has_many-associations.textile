title: Getting association_ids in has_many associations
---
Until today I didn't know that this was possible.

<pre>
class State < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :cities
end

>> State.first.city_ids
  State Load (1) SELECT * FROM `states` LIMIT 1
  City Load (4)  SELECT * FROM `cities` WHERE (`cities`.state_id = 14) 
=> [164, 174, 112, 311]
</pre>

@state.city_ids is a method available by virtue of has_many association.

However notice that even though I need only the ids, all the columns are being retrieved. This will be fixed in Rails 2.2 . Because of the fix the query might look like this.

SELECT `cities`.id FROM `cities` WHERE (`cities`.state_id = 14)
