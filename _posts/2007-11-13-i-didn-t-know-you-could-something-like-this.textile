title: I didn't know you could something like this

<pre>
if event_date >= today
        @todays_events
elsif event_date == yesterday
        @yesterdays_events
else
        @events
end << event

</pre>

rather than doing

<pre>
if event_date >= today
        @todays_events << event
elsif event_date == yesterday
        @yesterdays_events << event
else
        @events << event
end 
</pre>
