title: Beware of capitalize method
---

Ruby's capitalize method turns the first character to uppercase and turns rest of characters to lowercase. This could be tricky. 

<pre>
>> "please meet Mr. John".capitalize
=> "Please meet mr. john"
</pre>

One easy way to solve it would be 

<pre>
>> tmp = "please meet Mr. John"
=> "please meet Mr. John"
>> tmp = tmp[0,1].upcase + tmp[1..-1] unless tmp.blank?
=> "Please meet Mr. John"
</pre>

However a better solution will be 

<pre>
class ::String
  def firstcap
    self.gsub(/^(\w)/) { $1.chars.capitalize }
  end
end  

>> "please meet Mr. John".firstcap
=> "Please meet Mr. John"

</pre>

I found the above proposed solution in a ruby forum. <br />
