title: Calling a javascript function buried in iframe from the main window
---
On a recent project I had a need to call a javascript function on an iframe from the main window. After googling for solution for a while I got the answer and it is working fine. I am posting the solution on my blog so that I have it handy next time I need it.

{% highlight js %}
<h1>Widget Demo</h1>

<p>
  <%= link_to_function  'Reload', 
                        "window.frames['widget_iframe'].refresh_widget();" %>
</p>

<p>
  <iframe 
    id="respond_to_widget" 
    scrolling="no" 
    frameborder="0" 
    border="0"
    name='widget_iframe'
    src="http://<%=request.host_with_port%>/widgets/show" 
    style='height: 800px;'        
  >
    
</p>    

{% endhighlight %}

In the above case the main window is attempting to invoke javascript function <code>refresh_widget</code> on iframe. <br />
