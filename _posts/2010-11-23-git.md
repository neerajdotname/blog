    # add only the file git already knows about. will ignore new files
    git add -u                             

    # dry run
    git add -n                             

##git blame##

git blame helps you identify the author of each line of code.

###common usage###

    (master)$ git blame config/environment.rb 
    49b8798d (Neeraj Singh  2010-03-17 17:09:24 -0400   1) # Copyright neeraj
    49b8798d (Neeraj Singh  2010-03-17 17:09:24 -0400   2) 
    ^08dfbff (John Doe      2009-11-25 10:39:05 -0500   3) # Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file
    ^08dfbff (John Doe      2009-11-25 10:39:05 -0500   4) 
    ^08dfbff (John Doe      2009-11-25 10:39:05 -0500   5) # Specifies gem version of Rails to use when vendor/rails is no
    647bdb7f (John Doe      2009-11-30 18:50:01 -0500   6) RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.3.5' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION

You can see that first two lines were changed by Neeraj. Rest of the lines were committed by John Doe. Some of the commits by John Doe have commit SHA1_HASH starting with <tt>^</tt>. In this context a <tt>^</tt> indicates that the corresponding line is part of very first initial commit.

###other usage###

    # display the same information as mentioned above. Howeve show 40 digit SHA1_HASH
    git blame -l foo.txt                
    
    git blame -L 40,60 foo.txt          # show blame info only for line numbers between 40 and 60
    git blame -L 40,+21 foo.txt         # show blame info for 21 lines after line number 40

##git branch##

    git branch                    # list all local branches and indicate which branch I am currently in
    git branch -v                 # all branch info with last commit
    git branch -a                 # list all local and remote branches
    git branch -r                 # list only the remote branches ( does not include local branches)
    git branch --no-merged        # list all the branches from which merge is yet to be done
    git branch --merged           # list all the branches which are already merged

##git cat-file##

Lists info about a commit.

    $ git cat-file -p 092b81b
    tree c77ac2b94a50da5ff3b54a6ec3e0be6eac536ee3
    parent 721f6bc7a9ee16a9dc244ddbc21f63c296ab9173
    author Neeraj Singh <neeraj.cmu@gmail.com> 1269944652 -0400
    committer Neeraj Singh <neeraj.cmu@gmail.com> 1269944652 -0400

    fixed jQuery bug

    $ git cat-file -t SHA1_HASH        # type of commit: commit or tree
    commit

##git checkout##

###create a branch###

    git co -b lab master^    # create a branch from one commit prior to master branch
    git co -b lab SHA1       # create a branch from a particular commit hash
    git co -b lab v0.1.27    # create a branch from a tag
    git co -b lab            # create a new branch called lab and switch to that branch
    git co -b lab origin/lab # pull a remote branch called lab

    git tag -l
    git co tag_name          # will checkout the whole repository for that tag



### when file and branch name is same###

Let's say that I have a file called lab and I have a branch called lab.

    git co -- lab       # this will act on file named lab
    git co ./lab        # this will act of file named lab
    git co lab          # this will act on branch named lab

###checking out a particular file###

    git co experiment -- app.js      # bring app.js from experiment branch to current branch
    git co v1.2.3 -- app.js          # bring app.js from tag v1.2.3
    git co origin/master -- app.js   # bring app.js from remote branch master
    git co HEAD -- app.js            # bring app.js from current HEAD
    git co HEAD^ -- app.js           # bring app.js from the version before the most recent commit

###reset everything or reset a file###

Get rid of all the working and staged changes from the current branch.

    git reset --hard HEAD # reset --hard is a dangerous operation. If mistakenly you 
                          # did reset --hard HEAD^ then you loose a commit
    git co -f             # this is a safer option 

    got co app.js         # get rid of local changes in app.js and reset it from current HEAD
    git co -f lab         # discard all the changes in the current branch and switch 
                          # to lab branch. this is same as git co -f; git co lab

##git cherry-pick##

I have committed something in lab branch which I want in master branch too. In this case I want to bring only a commit from lab branch to master.

    git cherry-pick SHA1_HASH


##git clean##

git clean deletes untracked files .

    # -d removes untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
    # -f force
    # -x do not use ignore rules. This allows removing all untracked files
    # -X remove only files ignored by git
    git clean -n -d







## Give me list of all the committs not yet pushed to remote##

    # tbd explain both + and - sign
    git cherry -v origin/master master
