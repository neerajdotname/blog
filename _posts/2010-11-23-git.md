I must admit that I had trouble understanding the various associations and  the semantics related to cascade and inverse in Hibernate. In order to fully  understand how the association works I decided to have different test cases  covering different combinations. I noted down the result in my notebook. On  various forums I see newbies like me struggling with the concepts of association  in hibernate. So I decided to put my test result on the blog.
This is git
