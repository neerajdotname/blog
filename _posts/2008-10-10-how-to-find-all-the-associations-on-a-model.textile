title: How to find all the associations on a model
---
I have a Person model and this model has a bunch of associations. It has some has_many and some belongs_to association. I need to find the list of all has_many and belongs_to associations.  Try this.

<pre>
>>Person.reflections.each {|k,v| pp v.macro.to_s + ' ' + v.name.to_s };nil
"has_many tags"
"has_many my_projects_including_default_project"
"belongs_to photo"
"has_many email_messages"
"has_many project_memberships"
"has_many form_responses"
"has_many activities"
"has_one preferences"
"has_many custom_field_responses"
"has_many organizations"
"has_many activity_executions"
"has_many project_events"
"has_many my_projects"
"has_many roles"
"has_many organizational_memberships"
"has_many projects"
</pre>

Note that I have ;nil in the end in script/console. If I don't add nil statement then after the output the whole Person.reflections hash will be printed and you would be wondering where did my output go. 

ActiveRecord stores all the association information in ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection class. One can interrogate this class to find out more information about the association.
