title: show_sql method to see sql statements in script/console
---

ruby script/console is a great utility. However when you perform an operation like 

{% highlight ruby %}
User.first
{% endhighlight %}

I would like to see the sql being generate right on the console rather going to the log file to see the sql.

Ideally you should configure your .irbrc as mentioned "here":http://toolmantim.com/article/2007/2/6/system_wide_script_console_logging . And if you do that then you will always get sql statements in your console.

However if you have not configured your .irbrc then in order to make it easy to see sql statements on console Jamis has a great tip.

def show_sql(stream = STDOUT)
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(stream)
  ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!
end

I put above code as an initializer in all the projects. Now anytime in script/console if you want to see the sql then just type show_sql and you will start seeing all the sql statements on console.

If you are running edge rails then "Pratik has posted a fix":http://m.onkey.org/2008/9/15/active-record-tips-and-tricks


{% highlight ruby %}
def log_to(stream=$stdout)
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(stream)
  ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.clear_reloadable_connections!
end
{% endhighlight %}
