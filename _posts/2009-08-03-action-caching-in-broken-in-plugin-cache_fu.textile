title: action caching in broken in plugin cache_fu
---

Y'day I noticed that action caching stopped working when I moved the caching mechanism from 'file storage' to 'memcached'. After some investigation I found that "cache_fu":http://github.com/defunkt/cache_fu/tree/master is broken.

Here is the code from ActionController.rb .

<pre>
def caches_action(*actions)
  return unless cache_configured?
  options = actions.extract_options!
  filter_options = { :only => actions, :if => options.delete(:if), :unless => options.delete(:unless) }

  cache_filter = ActionCacheFilter.new(:layout => options.delete(:layout), 
                                       :cache_path => options.delete(:cache_path), 
                                       :store_options => options)
  around_filter(cache_filter, filter_options)
end

class ActionCacheFilter #:nodoc:
  def initialize(options, &block)
    @options = options
  end
  
  ...
end
</pre>

Notice that when an instance of <tt>ActionCacheFilter</tt> is created, the list of actions on which caching is to be performed is not passed. cache_fu assumes that it has access to <tt>*actions</tt> and that's why the code fails.

Here is snippet from cache_fu .

<pre>
def self.setup_rails_for_action_cache_options
  puts 'setup_rails_for_action_cache_options called'
  ::ActionController::Caching::Actions::ActionCacheFilter.class_eval do
    # convert all actions into a hash keyed by action named, with a value of a ttl hash (to match other cache APIs)
    def initialize(*actions, &block)
      puts 'initialize in action is called'
      if [].respond_to?(:extract_options!)
        #edge
        puts "actions is #{actions.inspect}"
        @options = actions.extract_options!
        @actions = actions.inject(@options.except(:cache_path)) do |hsh, action|
            action.is_a?(Hash) ? hsh.merge(action) : hsh.merge(action => { :ttl => nil })
          end
      ...
    end
  end
end
</pre>

As you can see in the intialize method of 'ActionCacheFilter' class the first parameter is erroneously named 'actions'. It should be more like options.

"The fix is easy":http://gist.github.com/160741 . We need to do three things which are at line numbers 20,33 and 55.
