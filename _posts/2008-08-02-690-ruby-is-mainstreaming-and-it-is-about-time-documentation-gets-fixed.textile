title: Ruby is mainstreaming and it is about time documentation gets fixed
---
Previously  I "blogged about":http://www.neeraj.name/638/to_yaml-is-not-core some of the documentation related issue with Ruby Doc. 

Here is another case. If you look at "Ruby documentation":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/ you will NOT find class 'Date'  under Classes. However in irb class Date is available to you. Check this out.

<pre>
> irb
>> d = Date.new
=> #<Date:0x5707c4>
>> d.class
=> Date
>> Date.parse('2008-08-09')
NoMethodError: undefined method `parse' for Date:Class
	from (irb):3
</pre>

Notice that in irb I do not do any require. By default class Date is available to us. And that class has certain methods like new. However if you invoke method 'parse' then there is a problem. In order to fix the problem we need to do require.

<pre>
>> require 'Date'
=> true
>> Date.parse('2008-08-09')
=> #<Date: 4909375/2,0,2299161>
</pre>


Notice that after the require statement, Date class has parse method. 

This is awkward. That's because as per the core documentation the class Date should not be available without require. And if it is available then it should have all the method loaded into it.

I have no idea how internally all this works. However as ruby is becoming mainstreaming it behooves to the community to fix these idiosyncrasies.
