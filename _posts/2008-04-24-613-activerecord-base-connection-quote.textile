title: ActiveRecord  Base.connection.quote
---
In constructing some of the complex queries I neeed to convert the time object into mysql datetime format. We also know that such values should be in single quote in the sql statements. So I created a small util.

<pre>
  def db_format(time)
    "'#{time.to_s(:db)}'"
  end
</pre>

Today I discovered that ActiveRecord already has such a utility which does this and much more. Check this out.

<pre>
>> t = Time.now
=> Thu Apr 24 00:05:43 -0400 2008
>> ActiveRecord::Base.connection.quote(t)
=> "'2008-04-24 00:05:43'"
</pre>

So the modified code becomes

<pre>
  def db_format(time)
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.quote(time)
  end
</pre>


Not a big deal but the rails code also takes care of database specific things. So if a different database server has a different quoting scheme then the new code will work just fine. Secondly it's also a good idea to pass on as much work as possible to the framework. After all many eyes are watching the framework.
