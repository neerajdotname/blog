title: sudo and cd issue in capistrano
---
I have following task in capistrano.

<pre>
  task :manage_log, :roles => :app do
    send(run_method, "cd #{current_path} && rake log:rotate")
  end
</pre>

The above task works fine when I am not using sudo. (set :use_sudo,false) in capistrano. When I trun sudo on (set :use_sudo,true) then the above task starts failing.   sudo doesn't play nice with cd because cd is a shell builtin.

However the fix is easy. Just put a ';' before cd in the taks. Like this.

<pre>
  task :manage_log, :roles => :app do
    send(run_method, ";cd #{current_path} && rake log:rotate")
  end
</pre>

capistrano will execute the task with sudo on without any problem.
