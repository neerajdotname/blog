title: View all your routes during startup of the server

Somehow I missed this tip and I badly need today to investigate why some of the REST routes were not working.

Add the following lines of code to see all your routes during start up.

<pre>
ActionController::Routing::Routes.routes.each do |r|
  puts r
end
</pre>

Similarly use the following code to see all named routes.

<pre>
ActionController::Routing::Routes.named_routes.routes.each do |name, route|
  puts "%20s: %s" % [name, route]
end
</pre>
