title: Javascript double equal vs triple equal
---

The double equal sign ( == ) in Javascript might trip you. The thing is that when you use double equal then Javascript does a type coercion before checking for equality.

{% highlight js %}
1 == '1' //true

false == 0 //true 
{% endhighlight %}

In the above case string 1 is same as numeric one if you are using double equal. This might not be what you wanted when you were checking for equality.

h2. Solution is triple equal 

Triple equal does not do type coercion and you will get right result.

<pre>
1 === '1' //false
false === 0 //false 
</pre>
