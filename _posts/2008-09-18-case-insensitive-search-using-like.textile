title: case insensitive search using like
---
Take a look at this.


<pre>
>> term = "Matz"
>> User.all :conditions => ["fname like ?", "%#{term}%"]
>> SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE (fname like '%Matz%') 
</pre>

Above code will work but sometimes it might fail. On my machine I have postgresql installed and the default installation does case-sensitive search. One way to do case-insensitive search in postrgesql is to change like to ilike but that's not very clean.

How about this.

<pre>
>> term = 'Matz'
>> User.all :conditions => ["Lower(fname) like ?", "%#{term.downcase}%"]
>> SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE (Lower(fname) like '%matz%') 
</pre>

I think all the databases support Lower function and the above code should work in all the databases.
