A lot of database operations are easily done using runner. 

<pre>ruby script/runner Event.db_mod -e production</pre>

In case where you don't want to load the full rails framework and speed matters one can write a program which will do exactly the same without the bloat.

<pre>
 #!/usr/bin/ruby
 # require AR and gems
 require 'rubygems'
 require 'active_record'
 require '../app/models/event'

 db_config = YAML::load(File.open("../config/database.yml"))
 ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(db_config['production'])
</pre>

Part of the reason why I mentioned the code is here so that I can refer to it when later I need it.
