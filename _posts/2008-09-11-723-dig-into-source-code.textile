title: Dig into source code
---
Dave Thomas recently posted "a blog":http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2008/09/fun-with-procs.html about proc and I got stumped at the very first line. 

{% highlight ruby %}
plus = lambda {|a,b| a + b}  
puts plus[1,2]
{% endhighlight %}

I would have written the code as 

{% highlight ruby %}
plus = lambda {|a,b| a + b}  
puts plus.call(1,2)
{% endhighlight %}

I needed to find out why the code plus[1,2] worked. I have a git clone of rubinius project. So I quickly opened up the source code for proc.rb and this is what I found.

{% highlight ruby %}
  alias_method :[], :call
{% endhighlight %}

I love ruby because it is so easy to go deep down and find the answers to such questions. All it took was less than 2 minutes to get the answer. So don't restrict yourself to just APIs. If you need to then go deep down. You will learn  a lot more.
