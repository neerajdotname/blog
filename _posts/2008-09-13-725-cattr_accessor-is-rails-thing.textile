title: cattr_accessor is rails thing
---
Since most of the ruby guys are introduced to ruby through rails, sometimes what belongs to ruby and what belongs to rails line gets blurried. Take for example cattr_accessor.

We all know about attr_accessor which is part of ruby. Ruby does not provide anything called cattr_accessor. This is introduced in ActiveSupport gem which rails uses. Here is how you can use cattr_accessor

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'activesupport'

class Person
   cattr_accessor :type
end

Person.type = 'developer'
puts Person.type
{% endhighlight %}
