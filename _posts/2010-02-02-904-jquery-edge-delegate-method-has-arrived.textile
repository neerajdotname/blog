title: jQuery edge  delegate method has arrived
---
One of the issues with live method is that live method first searches through all the elements then throws away the result.

<pre>
$('p').live('click', function({})
</pre>

In the above case jQuery does nothing with the selected <tt>p</tt> elements. Since the result does not really matter, it is a good idea to remove such codes from the <tt>document ready</tt> callbacks list.

So instead of doing this 

<pre>
$(function(){
$('p').live('click', function({})
})
</pre>

just do this

<pre>
$('p').live('click', function({})
</pre>

h2. Going a step further

John just landed "this commit which adds delegate":http://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/31432e048f879b93ffa44c39d6f5989ab2620bd8#comments method . 

Html markup

<pre>
<div id='lab'>
  <p>p inside lab</p>
</div>
<p>p outside lab</p>
</pre>

If you want to track all the clicks on p then you could write like this.

<pre>
$(document).delegate('p','click', function(){
  log('p was clicked');
});
</pre>

However if you only want to track clicks on 'p' which are inside the id <tt>lab</tt> then you can write like this.

<pre>
$('#lab').delegate('p','click', function(){
  log('p was clicked');
});
</pre>

Note this functionality is in jQuery edge and is not available in jQuery 1.4.1. So you will have to get jQuery code from github to play with it.
