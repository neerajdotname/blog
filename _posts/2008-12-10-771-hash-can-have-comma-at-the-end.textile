title: Hash can have comma at the end
---
Check this out. Pay attention to the last comma in options.

{% highlight ruby %}
options = {
  :limit => 20,
  :order => 'created_at',
  :conditions => {},
}

User.find(:all,options)
{% endhighlight %}

Ryan told me that hash can have a trailing comma and ruby does not complain about it. This could be useful if you want to move the last key to the very top.

However it looks weird to me to have a dangling comma at the end. I don't think I would put a trailing comma even though ruby does not complain about it. <br />
