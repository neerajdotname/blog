title: Ways to create String
---
If I have to create a string I always used to use Q along with curly braces like this.

{% highlight ruby %}
f = 'foo'      
puts %Q( This is me #{f} ) #=> This is me foo       
{% endhighlight %}

Today accidentally I found out that I don't need that capital Q. 

{% highlight ruby %}
f = 'foo'      
puts %{ This is me #{f} } #=> This is me foo 
{% endhighlight %}

Not only that I can use parenthesis <tt>()</tt> in stead of curly braces.

{% highlight ruby %}
f = 'foo'      
puts %( This is me #{f} ) #=> This is me foo 
{% endhighlight %}

All these solutions also work with text being spread across multi line. 

Here are my complete test cases.

<pre>
f = 'foo'
puts %( This is me #{f} ) #=> This is me foo 
puts %Q( This is me #{f} ) #=> This is me foo 
puts %q( This is me #{f} ) #=> This is me #{f}
puts %{ This is me #{f} } #=> This is me foo 
puts %Q{ This is me #{f} } #=> This is me foo 
</pre>
