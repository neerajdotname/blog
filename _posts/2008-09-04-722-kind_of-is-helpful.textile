title: kind_of? is helpful
---
ruby has this method kind_of? which so far I did not use for some reason.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Person
end

class Doctor < Person
end

d = Doctor.new
puts d.class.ancestors.include?(Person)
{% endhighlight %}

As illustrated above if I need to find if an object comes from Person I used to take help of ancestors. It was ugly but it worked. The same thing is done by kind_of? so the improvised code will be 

{% highlight ruby %}
puts d.kind_of?(Person)
{% endhighlight %}
