title: kind_of? is helpful
---
ruby has this method kind_of? which so far I did not use for some reason.

<pre>
class Person
end

class Doctor < Person
end

d = Doctor.new
puts d.class.ancestors.include?(Person)
</pre>

As illustrated above if I need to find if an object comes from Person I used to take help of ancestors. It was ugly but it worked. The same thing is done by kind_of? so the improvised code will be 

<pre>
puts d.kind_of?(Person)
</pre>
