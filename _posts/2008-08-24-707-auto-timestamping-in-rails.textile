title: Auto timestamping in Rails
---
Rails automatically populates columns created_at/created_on and updated_at/updated_on . This has been a great boon. Developers do not need to worry about updating the timestamps.

Question is how does rails implement this feature?

Answer: rails cheats.

In the active record lib directory there is a file called timestamp.rb . Given below is snippet of code from that file.

{% highlight ruby %}
module Timestamp
    def self.included(base) #:nodoc:
      base.alias_method_chain :create, :timestamps
      base.alias_method_chain :update, :timestamps
   end
end
{% endhighlight %}

So the answer is that create method is changed to create_with_timestamps and update method is changed to update_with_timestamps using the alias_method_chain.
