I am a Ruby on Rails [contributor](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/neeraj-singh/commits) .

I am a jquery-ujs [committer](http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/commits/master?author=neerajdotname). I wrote the [test suite](http://twitter.com/josevalim/status/15171367066) for JavaScript. Yes writing tests for JavaScript could be fun too.

[admin_data](http://github.com/neerajdotname/admin_data) is a Rails engine ,I wrote, that allows to quickly browse, search and manage database using simple web interface. Live Demo is available [here](http://admin-data-test.heroku.com/admin_data).

      I created <a href='http://github.com/neerajdotname/active_record_no_table'>active_record_no_table</a> . It is a Rails plugin which allows a model to have ActiveRecord validation features even though the model does not have a corresponding table in the database.

However he committed my test case.
