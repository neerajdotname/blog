##Open source contribution##

I [contribute](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/neeraj-singh/commits) to Ruby on Rails.

I am a jquery-ujs [committer](http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/commits/master?author=neerajdotname). Besides code fixes I also wrote the [test suite](http://twitter.com/josevalim/status/15171367066) for rails.js. Yes writing tests for JavaScript could be fun too.

[admin_data](http://github.com/neerajdotname/admin_data) is a Rails engine to quickly browse, search and manage database using web. Live demo is available [here](http://admin-data-test.heroku.com/admin_data).

Inline confirmation makes more sense in many cases. [iconfirm](http://github.com/neerajdotname/iconfirm) is an inline confirmation plugin poweredy by jQuery.  [Live demo]( http://neerajdotname.github.com/iconfirm) is available .

I love hoptoad. I was working on a Goverment project where the application did not have access to hoptoad. Since I was already used to hoptoad API, I developed [exception2db](http://github.com/neerajdotname/exception2db) which uses hoptoad API except that exception information is sent to a local database and not to hoptoad service. Developers continue to use hoptoad API without caring about where the exception info is stored.

[handy](http://github.com/neerajdotname/handy) is a gem that helps me populate local database with production data to help debug an issue. It also regularly backups data on s3.

[active_record_no_table](http://github.com/neerajdotname/active_record_no_table) is a Rails plugin which allows a model to have ActiveRecord validation features even though the model does not have a corresponding table in the database. Now that Rails3 has been released this plugin is not that useful.

On the nodejs mailing list, I notice a lot of people were having problem just getting started with nodejs.  I created [node-chat-in-steps](http://github.com/neerajdotname/node-chat-in-steps) whichs helps one get started with developing a chat system using nodejs .

[always_at_bottom](http://github.com/neerajdotname/always_at_bottom) is jQueryp plugin which ensures that footer is always at the very bottom of the web page.

I made [a commit to jQuery](http://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/532bec4c694532acbe2e14ad3b6ff72a4da90be0) to fix replace method. I submitted two committs: one for the bug fix and one supporting test case. By  the time John picked up my committ, the bug was already fixed because of some other code change.  However he committed my test case.

[jQueryBugLink](http://github.com/neerajdotname/jQueryBugLink) is a chrome Extension that converts bug id mentioned in the commit message into a link. Similarly [railsBugLink](https://github.com/neerajdotname/railsBugLink) converts rails ticket id mentioned in the commit message into a link.

##Presentations##

I have presented [Callbacks in Rails3](http://callbacks-in-rails3.heroku.com) at [DCRug](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/calendar/13808757), [Baltimore on Rails](http://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/calendar/15159698) and [NovaRUG](http://novarug.org/articles/2010/11/23/nov-30-callbacks-in-rails3-by-neeraj-singh) .

##Personal Project##
