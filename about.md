I love hoptoad. I was working on a Goverment project where the application did not have access to hoptoad. Since I was already used to hoptoad API, I developed [exception2db](http://github.com/neerajdotname/exception2db) which uses hoptoad API except that exception information is sent to a local database and not to hoptoad service. Developers continue to use hoptoad API without caring about where the exception info is stored.

[handy](http://github.com/neerajdotname/handy) is a gem that helps me populate local database with production data to help debug an issue. It also regularly backups data on s3.



[active_record_no_table](http://github.com/neerajdotname/active_record_no_table) is a Rails plugin which allows a model to have ActiveRecord validation features even though the model does not have a corresponding table in the database. Now that Rails3 has been released this plugin is not that useful.
